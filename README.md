# FixMyCity-Civic-Issue-reporting-app
## Description<br>
Unreported and unresolved civic issues are a grave issue especially in densely populated countries like india.&lt;br>
To provide a solution to this, as a part of CodeSlayer 2k25 hackathon, my team created an Expo based app named "FixMyCity"<br>
## How to run [For V1] <br>
‚û°Ô∏è Step 1: Download the zip from Github repo.<br>
‚û°Ô∏è Step 2: Open terminal and navigate to the downloaded folder.<br>
‚û°Ô∏è Step 3: Install dependencies:<br>1.npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/native-stack<br>2. npx expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context<br>3. npx expo install expo-image-picker expo-location<br>
‚û°Ô∏è Step 4: Start the server<br>‚ú®npx expo start<br>
üõë **Please note that the app is being hosted locally so the host and the client should be on the same network**
## Features<br>
‚≠ê Users can snap a photo, add a short description and post the issue within a minute.<br>
‚≠ê Users can also **comment**, **upvote/downvote** on other users post so that the most alarming issue can surface to the top.<br>
‚≠ê Our app has a seperate **Admin login panel**, where the authorities can login and check the issues present on a map.<br>
‚≠ê **Heatmaps** are automatically created on the map where the issue is located, the heatmap markings may grow big or small depending on the number of downvotes or upvotes the problem recieves.<br>
‚≠ê For a clean, clutter free and easy to work with interface there is an option to **change the current status** of problems, there are three possible states namely, <br>‚ú®1. Reported - In this state the problem has been reported on the apps and authorities are yet to take action on it.<br>‚ú®2. In progress - In this state, the problem has been noticed by the respective authority and action has been taken to resolve it.<br>‚ú®3. Solved - In this state the problem has been solved, also the **heatmaps** of all the problems marked as solved are **removed from the map** to keep the map clean and ready for more issues.<br>
## Future updates(if selected)<br>
If our project gets selected for round 2, there are going to be future updates to the app. Here's what is planned:<br>
‚≠ê Integration of MongoDB for real time updates and tracking.<br>
‚≠ê AI powered issue detection: We will train an AI to automatically analyse the image and detect what type of problem it is.<br>
‚≠ê Predictive analytics dashboard(Adv): In the admin panel there is going to be a seperate section titled "Predictions", where we can show the areas where problems are likely to occur using data analysis.<br>
‚≠ê Cross-Platform Expansion - Extend support to IOS.<br>
‚≠ê Automated SMS/Email Updates - Users get automatic notifications when their problems are under action and when they get resolved.
